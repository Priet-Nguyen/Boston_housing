# Boston_housing
Boston housing price prediction based on a range of linear regression and tree-based models and some feature engineering techniques.

In this project I investigate the Boston Housing dataset. The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle, which contains 506 samples and 15 feature variables. 
The purpose of my project is to predict the value of prices of the house based on the other given features. An Exploratory Data analysis will 
be first handled and afterwards a range of linear regression and tre-based models will be performed. The results show that after using removing outliers technique, 
LR and RF works much better. Specifically, LR can even works better than RF and the Ridge LR outputs a better results than LR. However we have to bear in mind that
RFs can give different results from different running based on its random nature. That is an evidence to confirm that feature engineering is very important in 
applying Machine Learning Models.
